# Singly Linked List Warm-Up

## 📌 Objective
This repository provides a basic **Singly Linked List** implementation. Your task is to **implement the `reverseLinkedList()` function** in `SinglyLinkedList.cpp`.

## 🚀 Instructions

### 1️⃣ Fork This Repository
Before making any changes, you need to fork this repository to your own GitHub account.
1. Click the **Fork** button at the top right of this repo.
2. This will create a copy under `https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/SinglyLinkedListWarmUp`.

### 2️⃣ Clone Your Fork
Once forked, clone it to your local machine:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/SinglyLinkedListWarmUp.git
cd SinglyLinkedListWarmUp
```

### 3️⃣ Create a New Branch
Always work on a new branch before making changes:
```sh
git checkout -b reverse-linked-list
```

### 4️⃣ Implement `reverseLinkedList()` in `SinglyLinkedList.cpp`
Your task is to **implement the `reverseLinkedList()` function**, which should reverse the linked list in place. **Do not modify other parts of the code.**

#### **Example**
If the original list is:
```
1 -> 2 -> 3 -> NULL
```
After calling `reverseLinkedList()`, it should become:
```
3 -> 2 -> 1 -> NULL
```

```sh
git add .
git commit -m "Implemented reverseLinkedList function"
```
